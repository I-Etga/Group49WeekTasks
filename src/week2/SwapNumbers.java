Numbers â€“ Swap Numbers
Swap two variables' values without using a third variable.

/*
By multiplying a and b, we store the combined value in a.
Then, by dividing a by b, we obtain the original value of b and store it in b.
Finally, by dividing the new value of a by the new value of b, we get the original value of a and store it back in a.
